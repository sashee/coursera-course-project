# Great!

This game is called _Guess the slope_, as your job is to identify the slope of a regression line for randomly generated points.

You can play the game at https://sashee.shinyapps.io/coursera-course-project .

Your progress are tracked during your session, so you can try to beat your best every time you play!

# How to play

Use the slider to adjust the line until you see fit.

```{r echo=FALSE}
  par(mfrow=c(1,2))

  set.seed(0)
  num <- 100
  solution <- 1.2
  data <- data.frame(x = runif(num, 0, 50))
  
  data$y <- lapply(data$x, function(x) {
    x * solution + rnorm(1, sd = 10)
  })

  plot(data$x, data$y, pch = 19, xlab = "x", ylab = "y", main = "1.5")
  lines(c(0, 50), c(0, 50 * 1.5), col = "red")

  plot(data$x, data$y, pch = 19, xlab = "x", ylab = "y", main = "1.2")
  lines(c(0, 50), c(0, 50 * 1.2), col = "red")
```
